Changes to the MultipleAccounts Tampermonkey Script
===

This version (1.4) brings smoothness to the script, while also retaining some great security.

I thank you for using this script, and I hope to see you here when I release a new version, don't worry, you will be notified as soon as a new version is installed on your browser.

**Protip:** if you dont see any update notifier, you might have *dismissed* it, if you didn't, click multiple times in the window.
