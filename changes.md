Changes to the MultipleAccounts Tampermonkey Script
===

This version (1.5) litteraly makes a corner rounder. Like, the green "login" buttons now have a corner radius of 5 pixels.

I litteraly added `border-radius: 5px;` to the file. *Except for other sruff that isn't really that interesting*.

I thank you for using this script, and I hope to see you here when I release a new version, don't worry, you will be notified as soon as a new version is installed on your browser.

**Protip:** if you dont see any update notifier, you might have *dismissed* it, if you didn't, click multiple times in the window.
